# 🚀 Fullstack API System with Node.js & TypeScript

This project is a modular fullstack system built with **Node.js** and **TypeScript**, designed to showcase and experiment with various API communication protocols and modern backend/frontend architecture patterns.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice and demonstrate skills in:
  - Backend service design with Node.js + TypeScript
  - Multiple communication interfaces: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, etc.
  - Fullstack deployment with separate frontend/backend
  - Scalable, maintainable architecture using modern tooling
  - Caching, database optimization, and real-time communication

## 🛠 Technologies Involved

- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express/Fastify, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket
- **Frontend**: Next.js or React (with Tailwind or similar)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions

---

## 📌 Notes

- Frontend and backend are deployed and developed separately for flexibility.
- Redis is used for caching to reduce DB load and improve performance.
- The system is modular to support plug-and-play communication protocols.
- This project is a long-term showcase of fullstack development practices.
